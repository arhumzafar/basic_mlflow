## MLflow

#### Arhum Zafar - Winter 2021

This repo consists of using MLflow to develop, monitor, and deploy a model. I have written a `Dockerfile` to assist with the deployment process.

Mlflow is a great tool that, in my opinion, can help avoid the pain of learning a new tech stack needed to maintain, track, and deploy models.
